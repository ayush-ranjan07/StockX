# StockX

Certainly, here's a README file for the project:

Welcome to the Stock Market Data analysis project! In this project, we will explore the data engineering by building a robust stock market data processing engine using Kafka and AWS services. This README will guide you through the project's overview, prerequisites, setup, and execution.

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate how to process real-time stock market data using Kafka, a distributed event store and stream processing platform, coupled with AWS services like S3 and Amazon Athena for data storage, querying, and analysis. The project is divided into three main segments: understanding prerequisites, comprehending Kafka's architecture, and hands-on implementation.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:

1. A laptop/desktop with a stable internet connection.
2. Python (version 3.5 or higher) installed on your system.
3. An AWS account to utilize AWS services.
4. Jupyter Notebook installed for an interactive coding environment.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.
   
2. **Setting Up AWS**: If you don't have an AWS account, sign up for one.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Open a terminal and install the required Python libraries by running:
   
   ```bash
   pip install kafka-python boto3
   ```
   
4. **Setting Up Kafka**: Set up Kafka on your system. 

5. **Running the Project**: Open Jupyter Notebook and execute the provided Python scripts step by step. These scripts will guide you through setting up producers, consuming data, using AWS S3 for data storage, and querying data with Amazon Athena.
